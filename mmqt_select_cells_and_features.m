% function mmqt_select_cells_and_features(fnameCZI, figureHide)
% function mmqt_select_cells_and_features(fnameMat, figureHide)
%
% Function selects cells, by checking certain exclusion criteria (see below) 
% and, in addition, it allows to keep only shape features, according to a 
% selection specified in the file "mmqt_feature_selection.xlsx" in column "include".
%
% Cells are excluded if they meet any of the following criteria:
% 1. Cells are touching any border of the Z-stack and the center of the
%   soma is too close to any of the touched border. The threshold for the 
%   minimum allowed distance can be chosen using the variables "thrDistBorderXY" 
%   and "thrDistBorderZ", defined below. Based on exploratory anayles, we 
%   recommend following:
%   at least 15 micrometer from the lateral borders of the stack (X/Y direction)
%   at least 8 micrometer from the bottom and top of the stack (Z direction).
% 2. Cells are touching each other and the centers of their soma are too 
%   close together. The recommended minimum distance is at least 15
%   micrometer and can be chosen using variable "thrDistCells" below.
% 3. Cell contains 2 nuclei, which migth be due to the fact,
%   that the soma of different cells are touching each other.
%
% 
% Input arguments:
%   fnameCZI      - path to CZI-file; note however, that this path-name
%                   will only be used to reconstruct the path-name of the MAT-file with the raw data (see below).
%                   In order to be found, the correspinding MAT-file should be stored in the same folder as the CZI-file.
%   fnameMat      - path to MAT-file, which contains a 4D matrix with the raw image matrix and a
%                   structure with the information about image size and scaling.
%                   This MAT-file can be created by reading CZI-files using the script: mmqt_read_convert_czi_files.m
%   figureHide    - logical, indicating whether to make figures visible or not
%                   If figureHide=true, figures will be made invisible and used only for saving picturs of the screenshot;
%                   (optional, defaults to figureHide=fasle)
